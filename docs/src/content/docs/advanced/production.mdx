## Compiler builds

`l3` optimizes production deployments of Lambda functions by minifying code with the [Speedy Web Compiler](https://swc.rs).

## Optimization warnings

Low import specificity affects startup performance for the Node.js runtime.
Top-level and wildcard imports cause slower startups for Node.js runtimes.

These import patterns should be avoided:

<Code code={`import {* as AWS} from "aws-sdk"\nimport AWS from "aws-sdk"`} lang="js" title="bad.js"/>

Imports like these produce warnings during the development process with `l3`.
