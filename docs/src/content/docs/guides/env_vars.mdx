<Aside type="caution" title="Env vars are unencrypted in transit">
    Encrypting environment variables in transit with AWS KMS is a pending feature.

    In the meantime, any AWS account with access to Lambda services will have visibility to these variables.
</Aside>

Environment variables are configured alongside the Lambda sources in the project's route directory.
An `.env` file will be deployed to any Lambdas at the HTTP path they accompany.
Environment variables can be scoped to a Lambda's HTTP method with a `delete.env`, `get.env`, `patch.env`, `post.env` or `put.env` file.

Environment variables for a specific Lambda configured by HTTP method (such as `get.env`) will override variables from that route directory's `.env` file.

<Aside type="note">
    `.env` variables are scoped only to the Lambdas at their HTTP route.

    `./routes/data/.env` variables will not be shared with Lambdas in other route directories.
</Aside>

Here is a project with a `lambda.mjs` with Lambdas for `GET /data` and `POST /data`:

<Code title="lambda.mjs" code={`export function GET() {\n    console.log(process.env.FOOD)\n}\n\nexport function POST() {\n    console.log(process.env.FOOD)\n}`}/>

The project structure looks like this:

<FileTree>
    - routes
        - data
            - lambda.mjs
            - .env
            - get.env
    - package.json
</FileTree>

The `GET /data` Lambda will be deployed with environment variables from `get.env` and `.env`. The `POST /data` Lambda will be deployed with the variables from `.env`.

Given these `.env` file contents:

<Code code={`SNACK=fries\nLOCALE=en-us`} title=".env"/>

<Code code={`SNACK=chips\nLOCALE=en-gb`} title="get.env"/>

The Lambdas would be deployed with these environment variables:

<Code code={`SNACK=chips\nLOCALE=en-gb`} title="GET /data"/>

<Code code={`SNACK=fries\nLOCALE=en-us`} title="POST /data"/>
