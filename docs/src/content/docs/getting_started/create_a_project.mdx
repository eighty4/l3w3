import {Code} from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

<Code code="l3 init" lang="sh"/>

`l3 init` generates a `./routes` directory in your project and a Hello World source file at `./routes/lambda.mjs`. The Hello World looks like this:

<Code code="export function GET() {}" lang="jh" title="./routes/lambda.mjs"/>

Lambdas are deployed to AWS Lambda and API Gateway with file-based routing.
Deploying your new project as it was generated will create a route and integration in API Gateway for a `GET /` request.
